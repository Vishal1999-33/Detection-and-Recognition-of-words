
Hey everybody! Its Naomi-lee here! Today I will be discussing my
favorite poem called ‘this poem... This poem is so interesting and also
very puzzling. I like this poem because it is funny and it is kind of like
washing up detergant averts because one of the lines in the poem is ‘it
should not be left within the reach of children, even adults’. It is very
comedic and made me laugh the first time I read it.

The thing that puzzles me about the poem is actually what another
student ,Kaiden, said which was ‘is this really a poem?’ this made me.
winder a little bit. Is it? This made me think in to my knowledge of
poems and I came to the conclusion that I am in fact not sure and
would like to hear another students ideas to help decide mine. I like the
end line ‘ words can seriously harm your heart’. I like this because in a
way it is true. Poems do have an effect on your emotions which is one
of the things I love about poems.They can take you away from society
and the real world.
