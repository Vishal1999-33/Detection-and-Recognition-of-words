There are a lot of health benefits associated with almonds.
Almonds are very high in vitamin E and protein as well as
other nutrients such as magnesium and phosphorus. Almonds
contain anti-cancer properties as well. Whether almonds are
best raw or pasteurized is still a source of heated debate.
