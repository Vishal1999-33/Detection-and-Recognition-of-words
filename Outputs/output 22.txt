Relationship Management
Introduction
The biggest management challenge in the new millennium of liberalization
and globalization for a business is to serve and maintain good relationship
with the king — rhe customer. In the past producers took their customers for
granted, because at that time the customers were not demanding nor had
alternative source of supply or suppliers. But today there is a radical
transformation. The changing business environment is characterized by
economic liberalization, increasing competition, high consumer choice,
demanding customer, more emphasis on quality and value of purchase etc.
All these changes have made today’s producer shift from traditional
marketing to modern marketing. Modern marketing calls for more than
developing a product, pricing it, promoting it and making it accessible to
target customer. It demands building trust, a binding force and value added
relationship with the customers.
The process of developing a cooperative and collaborative relationship
between the buyer and seller is called customer relationship management
shortly called CRM. According to Ashoka dutt head of Citi Bank “the idea
of CRM is to know the individual customer intimately, so that the company.
has a customized product ready for him even before he asks for it.”
